"Bitcoin needs you" ... with these words [Adam Jonas](https://x.com/adamcjonas ) finished his inspirative initial talk for [BOSS 2026](https://bosschallenge.xyz) . For me this will be second run of this fun but very challenging set of challenges as I already participated last year.

But this time these words resonated with me more, because have realized, that I need Bitcoin more than Bitcoin needs me. Reason why this year I have decided to make a difference is that in the end of last year right before Christmas my son Albert was born. 

And I have realized that if I want for him bright future full of possibilities I have to guard, contribute to and make better one of the most important technologies, which have ever been invented - Bitcoin.

Last year despite finishing all challenges I was able to convert the opportunity by very small contribution to [siml-ln](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/sim-ln/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Ajirigrill) repository. I consider it as my personal failure that I have not continued, but over the year I got distracted and lost motivation.

This year my goal is not only finish all the challenges, but as Jonas said "I am ready to make a difference". Equipped with finished [Rust book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu) (if you are starting with Rust it is must read!) and hands-on short exercises [rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org)  my plan is:
- finish all challenges
- use only Rust language
- use Claude Code for explanation of things I will not understand
- blog about every challenge
- **make the differnce**
